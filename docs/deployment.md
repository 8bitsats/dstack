# Deployment of DStack

This document describes the deployment of DStack components on bare metal TDX hosts.
It contains steps to deploy KMS and Tproxy into CVMs.

## Prerequisites

- Follow the [TDX setup guide](https://github.com/canonical/tdx) to setup the TDX host.
- Install `cargo` and `rustc`

## Clone the DStack repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack
```
## Compile and Run teepod
```bash
cd dstack
cargo build --release -p teepod -p supervisor
mkdir -p teepod-data
cp target/release/teepod teepod-data/
cp target/release/supervisor teepod-data/
cd teepod-data/

# create teepod.toml. Edit the config as needed.
cat <<EOF > teepod.toml
address = "unix:./teepod.sock"
reuse = true
image_path = "./images"
run_path = "./run/vm"

[cvm]
kms_urls = ["https://kms.test2.dstack.phala.network:9201"]
tproxy_urls = []
cid_start = 30000
cid_pool_size = 1000

[cvm.port_mapping]

range = [
    { protocol = "tcp", from = 1, to = 20000 },
    { protocol = "udp", from = 1, to = 20000 },
]

# Download Guest OS images
wget "https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/meta-dstack/releases/download/v0.4.1/dstack-0.4.1.tar.gz"
mkdir -p images/
tar -xvf dstack-0.4.1.tar.gz -C images/
rm -f dstack-0.4.1.tar.gz

# run teepod
./teepod
```

## Deploy the KmsAuth contract

A KMS node requires a KMSAuth contract to be deployed on the Ethereum-compatible network.

```bash
cd dstack/kms/auth-eth
npm install
npx hardhat compile
PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key> npx hardhat kms:deploy --network phala
```
It will deploy the KmsAuth contract to the Phala network and print the contract address:

```

```

## Deploy KMS into CVM
The teepod is running now. Open another terminal and go to the `kms/tapp/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd dstack/kms/tapp/
./deploy-to-teepod.sh 
```
It will create a template `.env` file. Edit the `.env` file and set the required variables.
Especially the `KMS_CONTRACT_ADDR` variable set to the address of the KmsAuth Proxy contract deployed in the previous step.
```
# .env
TEEPOD_RPC=unix:../../teepod-data/teepod.sock
KMS_CONTRACT_ADDR=0xFE6C45aE66344CAEF5E5D7e2cbD476286D651875
KMS_RPC_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9201
GUEST_AGENT_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9205
ETH_RPC_URL=https://rpc.phala.network
GIT_REV=HEAD
OS_IMAGE=dstack-0.4.0
```

Then run the script again.

Then it will deploy the KMS CVM to the teepod. Outputs:

```
App compose file created at: .app-compose.json
Compose hash: ec3d427f62bd60afd520fce0be3b368aba4516434f2ff761f74775f871f5b6e3

Created VM with ID: f5299298-bf4f-43c0-839c-88c755391f3c
```

Go back to the teepod-data directory and check the status of the KMS CVM:
```bash
cd ../../teepod-data/
tail -f run/vm/f5299298-bf4f-43c0-839c-88c755391f3c/serial.log
```

Wait until the KMS CVM is ready:
```

[  OK  ] Finished Record Runlevel Change in UTMP.
```

Now open your browser and go to the KMS listening address:
```
http://127.0.0.1:9201/
```
Click Bootstrap button then fill in the domain serving the KMS. For example: `kms.test2.dstack.phala.network`.
![alt text](assets/kms-bootstrap.png)
You should use the domain name that you will use to access the KMS.
Then click [Bootstrap] -> [Finish setup].
It will display the public key and corresponding TDX quote of the KMS as shown below:
![alt text](assets/kms-bootstrap-result.png)
The KMS info should be then set to the kms-auth-contract [here for this example](https://explorer.phala.network/address/0xFE6C45aE66344CAEF5E5D7e2cbD476286D651875?tab=write_proxy&source_address=0xa1b5B4Eb15E9366D2e11943F5fE319b62a6E9Da3#0x7d025352):
![alt text](assets/kms-auth-set-info.png)
The KMS instance is now ready to use.

## Deploy Tproxy in CVM
Tproxy can be deployed as a Tapp in the same host as the KMS or in a different host.

### Add base image MRs to the KMS whitelist
In order to run user workloads that use the KMS, the OS image MRs must be added to the KMS whitelist.

The `mrSystem` is calculated from the MRTD, RTMR0, RTMR1, and key provider. It varies with the same image given different CPU/MEM configurations.

You can calculate the `mrSystem` by running `dstack-mr` or simply try deploying an App with the OS image and see it in the serial logs.

After you get the `mrSystem`, you can register it to the KMS whitelist by running the following command:

```bash
cd dstack/kms/auth-eth
npx hardhat kms:add-system --network phala --mr <mr-value>
```

### Register Tproxy in KMS
As a normal Tapp, it requires the app to be registered in the KmsAuth contract first.

```bash
cd dstack/kms/auth-eth
npx hardhat app:deploy --network phala
```

This will deploy an AppAuth contract in the KmsAuth contract and print the app ID:

```

```

Now go to the `tproxy/tapp/` directory and run the following command:
```bash
cd ../../tproxy/tapp/
./deploy-to-teepod.sh 
```

It will create a template .env file. Edit the .env file and set the required variables.

```
# .env
TEEPOD_RPC=unix:../../teepod-data/teepod.sock

# Cloudflare API token for DNS challenge used to get the SSL certificate.
CF_API_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_api_token
CF_ZONE_ID=your_zone_id

# Service domain
SRV_DOMAIN=test2.dstack.phala.network

# Public IP address
PUBLIC_IP=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)

# Tproxy application ID. Register the app in KmsAuth first to get the app ID.
TPROXY_APP_ID=0x31884c4b7775affe4c99735f6c2aff7d7bc6cfcd

# Whether to use ACME staging (yes/no)
ACME_STAGING=yes

# Subnet index. 0~15
SUBNET_INDEX=0

# My URL. The URL will be synced to other nodes in the cluster so that each node can discover other nodes.
MY_URL=https://tproxy.test2.dstack.phala.network:9202

# Bootnode URL. If you want to deploy a multi-node Tproxy cluster, set the bootnode URL to the URL of another node already deployed or planed to be deployed later.
BOOTNODE_URL=https://tproxy.test2.dstack.phala.network:9202

# DStack OS image name
OS_IMAGE=dstack-0.4.0

# Set defaults for variables that might not be in .env

# Port configurations

GUEST_AGENT_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9206
WG_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9202
```

Then run the script again.
It should show the prompt to confirm the deployment:
```
App compose file created at: .app-compose.json

TPROXY_SERVING_ADDR: 0.0.0.0:9204
GUEST_AGENT_ADDR: 127.0.0.1:9206
Continue? [y/N]
```

Don't press `y` yet. We need to add the compose hash to the AppAuth contract first. Go back to the `kms/auth-eth` directory and run the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat app:add-hash --network phala --app-id 0x31884c4b7775affe4c99735f6c2aff7d7bc6cfcd 0x700a50336df7c07c82457b116e144f526c29f6d8f4a0946b3e88065c9beba0f4
```

After the transaction is confirmed, you can press `y` to continue the deployment.

Similar to the KMS deployment, it will deploy the Tproxy CVM to the teepod and it will start serving later.

## Deploy teepods to serve user workloads
After the KMS and Tproxy are deployed, you can deploy teepods on other TDX hosts to serve user workloads.

Edit the teepod.toml file to set the KMS and Tproxy URLs.

```
# teepod.toml
[cvm]
kms_urls = ["https://kms.test2.dstack.phala.network:9201"]
tproxy_urls = ["https://tproxy.test2.dstack.phala.network:9202"]
```
